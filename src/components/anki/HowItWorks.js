            <p>This system works using cards, in the front you see a subject to study, in the back you read the answer.</p>
            <p>Once you see the card front, answer yourself, click it, and then rate how hard it was for you</p>
            <p>If you had a hard time, select the red button, if it was easy click the green button, pretty easy</p>
            <p>When you find hard to answer something we are going to show you again this card a bit more often and if it was easy then you will see it much later</p>
